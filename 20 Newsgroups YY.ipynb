      "This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\n",
      "have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\n",
      "should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\n",
      "would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\n",
      "relevant books are listed in a companion article.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\n",
      "as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\n",
      "questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\n",
      "up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\n",
      "frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\n",
      "posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\n",
      "questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\n",
      "who proselytize on alt.atheism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\n",
      "Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\n",
      "being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\n",
      "may not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is atheism?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n",
      "Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n",
      "often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\n",
      "atheism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\n",
      "atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\n",
      "atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n",
      "fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\n",
      "atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\n",
      "flat-out denials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\n",
      "it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\n",
      "believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\n",
      "not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\n",
      "Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\n",
      "disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\n",
      "must be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\n",
      "sure whether God exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\n",
      "you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\n",
      "that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\n",
      "use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\n",
      "referring to \"strong atheism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Beware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\n",
      "is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\n",
      "sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\n",
      "the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\n",
      "about the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\n",
      "particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\n",
      "is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\n",
      "such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\n",
      "see no evidence that God exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\n",
      "quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\n",
      "all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\n",
      "obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\n",
      "well-defined is a matter for debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\n",
      "impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\n",
      "God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\n",
      "show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n",
      "\n",
      "If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\n",
      "question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\n",
      "may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\n",
      "might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\n",
      "often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\n",
      "primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\n",
      "unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\n",
      "the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\n",
      "prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\n",
      "tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\n",
      "prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\n",
      "default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\n",
      "exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\n",
      "varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\n",
      "may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\n",
      "possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\n",
      "book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\n",
      "by any present-day religion exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\n",
      "close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\n",
      "that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\n",
      "God are not really applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\n",
      "must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\n",
      "detectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\n",
      "does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\n",
      "that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\n",
      "importance whether he exists or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\n",
      "Surely he should still be detectable today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\n",
      "verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\n",
      "effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\n",
      "from all the other things that don't exist?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n",
      " isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\n",
      "redefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\n",
      "that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\n",
      "statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\n",
      "then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\n",
      "it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\n",
      "uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\n",
      "redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\n",
      "to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\n",
      "atheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n",
      "\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\n",
      "controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\n",
      "worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n",
      "  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n",
      "\n",
      "Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\n",
      "categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n",
      "\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\n",
      "human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\n",
      "science, politics, and watching TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n",
      " still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\n",
      "actually believes in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\n",
      "make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\n",
      "try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\n",
      "questioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\n",
      "assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\n",
      "the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n",
      "\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\n",
      "acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\n",
      "According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\n",
      "faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\n",
      "religious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\n",
      "general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\n",
      "state with certainty that the universe exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\n",
      "Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\n",
      "has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\n",
      "even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\n",
      "the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n",
      "\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\n",
      "it can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\n",
      "speak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\n",
      "have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n",
      "\n",
      "This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\n",
      "Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\n",
      "will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\n",
      "course, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\n",
      "many countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\n",
      "when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\n",
      "impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\n",
      "of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\n",
      "worship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\n",
      "Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\n",
      "order to gain complete power over the population.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\n",
      "religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\n",
      "the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\n",
      "church and state should remain separate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n",
      " surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\n",
      "not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\n",
      "means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\n",
      "another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\n",
      "nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\n",
      "example, religious believers have historically been responsible for\n",
      "encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\n",
      "campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\n",
      "religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\n",
      "and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\n",
      "are quite happy to see them have their say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n",
      " pray?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\n",
      "that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\n",
      "schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\n",
      "need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\n",
      "that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\n",
      "acceptable to all those present at any public event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\n",
      "to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\n",
      "motives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n",
      " atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n",
      " atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\n",
      "contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\n",
      "the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\n",
      "for charities founded on a theistic basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\n",
      "connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\n",
      "matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\n",
      "self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\n",
      "of religious beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\n",
      "rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\n",
      "birthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n",
      " one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\n",
      "force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\n",
      "choose to call themselves atheists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\n",
      "backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\n",
      "other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\n",
      "expectations of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\n",
      "backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\n",

      "\n",
      "Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\n",
